# Contentful Content Migration Examples
These scripts are used in our "Content as Code" developer course.

To go through the example migration scripts first spin up a new PoC space and import the JSON export file using the Contentful CLI:
`contentful space import --space-id <your space id> --content-file ./contentful-exports/blog-post-example.json`

Then spin up new environments and run the example migration scripts, in order, per the video.
